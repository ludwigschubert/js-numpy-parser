# numpy-parser
A JS parser for (binary) `.npy` files, supporting all TypedArray subclasses:

* float32 & float64
* int8, int16, int32
* uint8, uint16, uint32

## Install via npm

```
npm install --save numpy-parser
```

## Example usage

```js
import { fromArrayBuffer } from "numpy-parser";

const url = â€¦
const response = await fetch(url);
const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
const { data, shape } = fromArrayBuffer(arrayBuffer);
```

For ergonomic usage I recommend wrapping this in, e.g. [this ndarray implementation](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray):

```js
import ndarray from "ndarray";
const array = ndarray(data, shape);
```

## Acknowledgements

This implementation was inspired by [this gist by nvictus](https://gist.github.com/nvictus/88b3b5bfe587d32ac1ab519fd0009607).

## Future Work

`.npy` files can encode floats as 16 bit long, too. While JS runtimes may not support this as a native data type, we could still consider supporting it and parsing into 32 bit floats to at least get the bandwidth savings in transit.
